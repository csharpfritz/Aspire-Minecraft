### Post 1 — The Hook

🎮 What if you could see your microservices health **inside Minecraft**?

Your API goes down → thunderstorm rolls in.
It recovers → the sun comes out.

This is real. It's a NuGet package. It ships today.

`dotnet add package Fritz.Aspire.Hosting.Minecraft`

🧵👇

### Post 2 — What It Is

Fritz.Aspire.Hosting.Minecraft is a .NET Aspire integration that turns a Minecraft world into a live operations dashboard.

One line to add a Minecraft server. Opt-in features for drama.

Built on RCON, OpenTelemetry, and Docker. MIT licensed.

### Post 3 — Boss Bar + Weather

🌩️ Your fleet health IS the weather.

• Clear skies = all services green
• Rain = degraded
• Thunderstorm = critical

Plus a boss bar at the top of the screen showing health % with color shifts (green → yellow → red).

---

### Post 4 — Title Alerts + Sound Effects

📢 Full-screen Minecraft title alerts when a service crashes:

⚠ "API DOWN" — in red, impossible to miss.
✅ "BACK ONLINE" — in green, with a level-up chime.

Wither growl on failure. Challenge complete fanfare when everything recovers. 🔊

---

### Post 5 — Particle Effects + In-World Structures

✨ Each monitored service gets its own torch-topped tower in the Minecraft world.

Healthy? Emerald blocks + happy villager particles.
Down? Redstone blocks + smoke & flame.

Floating holograms and a scoreboard sidebar show status at a glance.

### Post 6 — What's Next

Coming in Sprint 2:

🎆 Fireworks when all services go green
👾 Guardian mobs at unhealthy resources
🔦 Beacon towers visible from anywhere
📊 Live metrics in your hotbar

And Sprint 3: a full Resource Village with redstone heartbeat circuits.
