## Setup Requirements (All Shots)

Before capturing any media, run the full demo:

```shell
cd samples/MinecraftAspireDemo/MinecraftAspireDemo.AppHost
dotnet run
```

**Running resources:**
- `minecraft` — Paper server (game port 25565, RCON 25575, BlueMap 8100)
- `api` — MinecraftAspireDemo.ApiService
- `web` — MinecraftAspireDemo.Web
- `cache` — Redis
- `db-host` / `db` — PostgreSQL

**Minecraft client:** Join `localhost:25565`, set render distance to 16, use a clean resource pack (vanilla or Faithful), and set GUI scale to Auto. Time of day: noon (`/time set noon`) for consistent lighting. Fly to structures (`/gamemode spectator` or `/fly`).

**Screen resolution:** Capture at 1920×1080 minimum. For social media crops, also grab 1:1 square versions.
