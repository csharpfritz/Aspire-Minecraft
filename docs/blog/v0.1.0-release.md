## What if you could see your microservices health inside Minecraft?

Picture this: you're standing in a Minecraft world, surrounded by emerald block towers — one for each service in your distributed system. A boss bar stretches across the top of your screen, glowing green. Everything is healthy.

Then someone pushes a bad config. Your API goes down.

The sky darkens. Thunder rolls in. A full-screen red alert flashes: **⚠ API DOWN**. The wither's ambient growl echoes through the world. Angry smoke particles billow from the API's tower, and the boss bar shifts to yellow.

You fix the config. The service recovers. The sun comes out, a level-up chime plays, and happy villager particles dance above the tower. The boss bar returns to green.

**This is real.** It's a NuGet package. It ships today.

`Fritz.Aspire.Hosting.Minecraft` is a .NET Aspire integration that turns a Minecraft world into a living, breathing operations dashboard for your distributed system. It's built on real infrastructure — RCON protocol, OpenTelemetry, Docker containers — and it's MIT licensed.

---

## Why? Because Observability Should Be Fun

Dashboards are great. Grafana is powerful. But there's something uniquely visceral about *standing inside* your telemetry.

- **238 million people** know how to navigate a Minecraft world. Your monitoring just became approachable.
- **.NET Aspire** already makes distributed apps easy to compose — this extends that mental model into a 3D world.
- **Conferences and demos** will never be the same. Nothing grabs attention like a Minecraft world reacting to your code in real time.
- **Learning tool:** new developers can *see* what "a service went unhealthy" actually looks and sounds like.

This isn't a toy. It uses the same RCON protocol that production Minecraft server admins use. It exports real OpenTelemetry metrics. It runs in Docker. It's just... also a game.

## Quick Start: 60 Seconds to Your First Minecraft Dashboard

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Minecraft Java Edition (to connect and see the world)

### 1. Install the package

```shell
dotnet add package Fritz.Aspire.Hosting.Minecraft --version 0.1.0
```

### 2. Wire it up in your AppHost `Program.cs`

```csharp
using Aspire.Hosting.Minecraft;

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var redis = builder.AddRedis("cache");
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyApi>("api");

var minecraft = builder.AddMinecraftServer("minecraft", gamePort: 25565, rconPort: 25575)
    .WithBlueMap(port: 8100)
    .WithOpenTelemetry()
    .WithAspireWorldDisplay<Projects.Aspire_Hosting_Minecraft_Worker>()
    .WithParticleEffects()
    .WithTitleAlerts()
    .WithWeatherEffects()
    .WithBossBar()
    .WithSoundEffects()
    .WithMonitoredResource(api)
    .WithMonitoredResource(redis);

builder.Build().Run();
```

Every `.With*()` method is opt-in. Start with just `AddMinecraftServer()` and layer on features as you like.

### 3. Run and connect

```shell
dotnet run
```

Open Minecraft Java Edition → Add Server → `localhost:25565` → join and explore!

> **Tip:** The first launch downloads the Paper server image (~1 GB) and generates the world. Give it 60–90 seconds on the first boot.

## Feature Tour: What Ships in v0.1.0

### 🏗️ Minecraft Server as a First-Class Aspire Resource

`AddMinecraftServer()` spins up a [Paper](https://papermc.io/) server in Docker via the trusted [`itzg/minecraft-server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server) image. It appears in the Aspire dashboard with game, RCON, and BlueMap endpoints. Other services can `.WaitFor()` the Minecraft server just like any database or cache.

```csharp
var minecraft = builder.AddMinecraftServer("minecraft");
// That's it. You have a Minecraft server managed by Aspire.
```

### 📊 OpenTelemetry — JVM Meets .NET

`.WithOpenTelemetry()` injects the OpenTelemetry Java agent into the Minecraft server container. JVM metrics (heap, GC, threads, CPU) flow into the Aspire dashboard alongside your .NET services. Game metrics (TPS, MSPT, player count) are polled via RCON and exported as custom OTEL metrics.

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| `jvm.memory.used` | Is the server running out of heap? |
| `minecraft.tps` | Is the server keeping up? (target: 20.0) |
| `minecraft.mspt` | How long each tick takes |
| `minecraft.players.online` | Who's connected |
| `minecraft.rcon.latency_ms` | RCON round-trip health |

### 🗺️ BlueMap — A 3D Web Map in Your Dashboard

`.WithBlueMap()` installs the [BlueMap](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/) plugin and exposes its web UI as an HTTP endpoint in the Aspire dashboard. Click it and you get a full 3D, interactive map of your Minecraft world — including the Aspire resource structures.

### 🏛️ In-World Health Display

`.WithAspireWorldDisplay<TWorker>()` registers a background worker that connects to the Minecraft server via RCON. Each `.WithMonitoredResource()` call creates:

- **A torch-topped structure** — emerald blocks for healthy, redstone blocks for unhealthy
- **A floating hologram** — resource name and current status, updated in real time
- **A scoreboard entry** — sidebar scoreboard showing all resources at a glance
- **Player chat alerts** — health changes announced as they happen

### 🌩️ Boss Bar Health Meter

`.WithBossBar()` adds a persistent bar at the top of the screen showing overall fleet health as a percentage. The color shifts with your system state:

- **Green** (≥ 75% healthy) — smooth sailing
- **Yellow** (25–74% healthy) — degraded
- **Red** (< 25% healthy) — critical

### ⛈️ Weather = System Health

`.WithWeatherEffects()` links Minecraft weather to your fleet's overall health ratio:

- **Clear skies** — 100% of services healthy
- **Rain** — some services degraded (≥ 50%)
- **Thunderstorm** — critical state (< 50%)

Weather only changes on state transitions, not every poll cycle — so the sky stays stable.

### 📢 Title Screen Alerts

`.WithTitleAlerts()` fires dramatic full-screen Minecraft title text on health transitions:

- **Red "⚠ SERVICE DOWN"** when a resource goes unhealthy
- **Green "✅ BACK ONLINE"** when it recovers

These are impossible to miss. That's the point.

### 🔊 Sound Effects

`.WithSoundEffects()` plays Minecraft sounds on health state changes:

- **Wither ambient growl** when a service goes down
- **Level-up chime** when a service recovers
- **Challenge complete fanfare** when all services return to green

### ✨ Particle Effects

`.WithParticleEffects()` adds visual flair at resource structures:

- **Smoke + flame particles** billow from a structure when its service goes down
- **Happy villager particles** dance above it when it recovers

## How It Works: Under the Hood

```
Your AppHost (Program.cs)
  │
  ├── builder.AddMinecraftServer("minecraft")
  │     → Docker: itzg/minecraft-server (Paper)
  │     → Ports: 25565 (game), 25575 (RCON), 8100 (BlueMap)
  │     → OTEL Java Agent → Aspire Dashboard
  │
  ├── .WithAspireWorldDisplay<Worker>()
  │     → .NET Worker Service (child resource)
  │     → RCON commands → Minecraft server
  │     → Polls resource health via HTTP/TCP
  │     → Publishes minecraft.* OTEL metrics
  │
  └── Your Services (API, Web, Redis, Postgres…)
        → Monitored via .WithMonitoredResource()
        → Visualized as in-world structures
```

**RCON (Remote Console)** is the Minecraft server's built-in admin protocol. The worker service speaks RCON to execute commands like `/bossbar set`, `/weather`, `/title`, `/particle`, and `/playsound`. It's the same protocol that production server admins use — reliable, low-overhead, and well-documented.

**The Worker Service** is a standard .NET `BackgroundService` that runs as a child resource of the Minecraft server in Aspire. It discovers monitored resources from environment variables injected by `WithMonitoredResource()`, polls their health endpoints, and translates health state into RCON commands. Each feature (boss bar, weather, particles, etc.) is opt-in via environment variables set by the corresponding `.With*()` extension method.

**State tracking** prevents command spam. The worker remembers the last weather state, boss bar value, and per-resource health so it only sends RCON commands when something actually changes.

## What's Next: Sprint 2 Preview

We're just getting started. Here's what's on the workbench:

- **🎆 Fireworks** — all services recover to green? The sky lights up.
- **🔦 Beacon Towers** — color-coded beacons per resource type, visible from anywhere in the world.
- **👾 Guardian Mobs** — unhealthy resources spawn guardian mobs near their structures. Fix the service to despawn the threat.
- **📊 Action Bar Ticker** — live TPS, memory, and resource counts in your hotbar area.
- **🎺 Deployment Fanfare** — special animations when a new deployment rolls out.

And in Sprint 3? A full **Resource Village** with themed buildings, **Redstone heartbeat circuits**, and **Achievement unlocks** ("Survived a Redis Outage!" 🏆).
