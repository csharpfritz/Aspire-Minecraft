# Aspire.Hosting.Minecraft v0.1.0 — Release Announcement Blog Post

> **Status:** Outline (draft)
> **Target publish:** Same day as v0.1.0 NuGet release tag
> **Author:** Jeff Fritz
> **Audience:** .NET developers who use Aspire; Minecraft-curious devs; conference attendees

---

## 1. Hook — "What if your distributed system could fight back?"

Open with the absurd-but-real premise: you can now monitor your .NET Aspire services **from inside Minecraft**. When your API goes down, the Minecraft sky turns to thunder. When everything recovers, the sun comes out.

- One sentence pitch: _"Aspire.Hosting.Minecraft lets you `dotnet run` a Minecraft server alongside your microservices — and watch your system health play out in-world."_
- Lead image: Minecraft screenshot showing emerald block structures with health status holograms, boss bar at the top, and the Aspire dashboard in a side-by-side view.

> **Tone:** Fun, slightly irreverent, but technically credible. This is a real integration, not a toy.

## 2. The "Why" — Observability Should Be Fun

- Dashboards are great; living inside your telemetry is better.
- .NET Aspire already makes distributed apps easy to compose — this extends that to a world 238 million people know how to navigate.
- Conferences, streams, and demos: nothing grabs attention like a Minecraft world reacting to your code in real time.
- Learning tool: new developers can _see_ what "a service went unhealthy" actually looks like.

## 3. Getting Started (60-second setup)

### Install the package

```shell
dotnet add package Fritz.Aspire.Hosting.Minecraft --version 0.1.0
```

### Wire it upin your AppHost

```csharp
using Aspire.Hosting.Minecraft;

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var redis = builder.AddRedis("cache");
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyApi>("api");

// One line to add a Minecraft server
var minecraft = builder.AddMinecraftServer("minecraft", gamePort: 25565, rconPort: 25575)
    .WithBlueMap(port: 8100)           // 3D web map in the Aspire dashboard
    .WithOpenTelemetry()               // JVM metrics → Aspire dashboard
    .WithAspireWorldDisplay<Projects.Aspire_Hosting_Minecraft_Worker>()
    .WithMonitoredResource(api)        // Each resource gets its own in-world cube
    .WithMonitoredResource(redis);

builder.Build().Run();
```

### Run and connect

```shell
cd samples/MinecraftAspireDemo/MinecraftAspireDemo.AppHost
dotnet run
```

Open Minecraft Java Edition → Add Server → `localhost:25565` → join and look around.

> **Callout box:** Prerequisites — .NET 10 SDK, Docker Desktop, Minecraft Java Edition client.

## 4. Feature Highlights

### 4a. Minecraft Server as a First-Class Aspire Resource

- `AddMinecraftServer()` spins up a [Paper](https://papermc.io/) server in Docker via the trusted `itzg/minecraft-server` image.
- RCON health check baked in — other services can `.WaitFor()` the Minecraft server just like any database or cache.
- The server appears in the Aspire dashboard with endpoints, logs, and health status.

```csharp
var minecraft = builder.AddMinecraftServer("minecraft");
// That's it. You have a Minecraft server.
```

### 4b. OpenTelemetry — JVM Meets .NET

- `.WithOpenTelemetry()` bind-mounts the OpenTelemetry Java agent into the container.
- JVM metrics (heap, GC, threads, CPU) flow into the same Aspire dashboard as your .NET services.
- Game metrics (TPS, MSPT, player count) are polled via RCON and exported as custom OTEL metrics.

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|---|---|
| `jvm.memory.used` | Is the server running out of heap? |
| `minecraft.tps` | Is the server keeping up? (target: 20.0) |
| `minecraft.mspt` | How long each tick takes |
| `minecraft.players.online` | Who's connected |
| `minecraft.rcon.latency_ms` | RCON round-trip health |

> **Screenshot placeholder:** Aspire dashboard metrics page showing JVM + Minecraft metrics side-by-side.

### 4c. BlueMap — A 3D Web Map in Your Dashboard

- `.WithBlueMap()` installs the BlueMap plugin and exposes its web UI as an HTTP endpoint.
- Click the endpoint in the Aspire dashboard and you get a full 3D, interactive map of your Minecraft world — including the Aspire resource structures.

> **Screenshot placeholder:** BlueMap web UI showing the in-world Aspire structures from above.

### 4d. In-World Health Display

- `.WithAspireWorldDisplay<TWorker>()` registers a background worker that connects to the Minecraft server via RCON.
- Each `.WithMonitoredResource()` gets:
  - **A torch-topped structure** — emerald blocks for healthy, redstone blocks for unhealthy.
  - **A floating hologram** — resource name and current status, updated in real time.
  - **A scoreboard entry** — sidebar scoreboard showing all resources at a glance.
- Player chat messages announce health changes as they happen.

> **Screenshot placeholder:** In-world view showing multiple resource cubes with holograms and the scoreboard sidebar.

### 4e. 🆕 Sprint 1: Weather, Boss Bars, Alerts, and More

These features ship with v0.1.0 and add real drama to your monitoring:

- **Boss Bar Health Meter** — a persistent bar at the top of the screen showing overall system health with color-coded segments.
- **Weather = System Health** — clear skies when everything is green; rain when degraded; thunderstorm when critical.
- **Title Screen Alerts** — full-screen Minecraft title text when a resource goes down (or recovers).
- **Sound Effects** — note block chimes for recoveries; wither sounds for failures.
- **Particle Effects** — happy particles at healthy structures; angry particles at failing ones.

> **GIF placeholder:** Weather changing from clear to thunderstorm as a service goes unhealthy, with boss bar updating and title alert appearing.

## 5. Architecture Overview

```
Your AppHost (Program.cs)
  │
  ├── builder.AddMinecraftServer("minecraft")
  │     → Docker: itzg/minecraft-server (Paper)
  │     → Ports: 25565 (game), 25575 (RCON), 8100 (BlueMap)
  │     → OTEL Java Agent → Aspire Dashboard
  │
  ├── .WithAspireWorldDisplay<Worker>()
  │     → .NET Worker Service (child resource)
  │     → RCON commands → Minecraft server
  │     → Polls resource health via HTTP/TCP
  │     → Publishes minecraft.* OTEL metrics
  │
  └── Your Services (API, Web, Redis, Postgres…)
        → Monitored via .WithMonitoredResource()
        → Visualized as in-world structures
```

- The worker discovers resources from environment variables injected by `WithMonitoredResource()`.
- Health polling uses HTTP for web services and TCP for databases/caches.
- All system→player messages are logged as structured OTEL events for audit.

## 6. What's Next — Sprints 2 & 3

We're just getting started. Here's a taste of what's coming:

- **Sprint 2 — "Polish & Atmosphere"**
  - Action bar metrics ticker (live TPS/memory in your hotbar area)
  - Fireworks when all services recover to green 🎆
  - Guardian mobs that spawn near unhealthy resources
  - Beacon towers per resource type
  - Deployment fanfare animations

- **Sprint 3 — "Showstopper"**
  - A themed **Resource Village** — each service gets its own building
  - Redstone heartbeat circuits pulsing with your system
  - Achievement unlocks ("First Deploy!", "Survived a Redis Outage")
  - Rail network connecting resource buildings

> This is the kind of project where community contributions are _especially_ welcome. Got a wild idea? Open an issue.
