### 2026-02-15: Grand Watchtower exterior redesigned for ornate medieval look
**By:** Rocket
**What:** Replaced the flat rectangular exterior with a visually rich medieval castle tower. Corner buttresses now use deepslate_bricks (darker contrast against stone_bricks). Turrets extend 2 blocks above the parapet (y+22) with pinnacle posts and banners at y+23. Gatehouse has a taller pointed arch (keystone at y+6) with iron_bars portcullis across the top of the door opening. Lower walls have cracked_stone_bricks weathering. Ground floor windows are iron_bars arrow slits. Observation windows are 2-high. String course corbel ledge runs above the first wool band. Machicolations remain on all 4 sides. Total method uses 85 RCON commands (was 84), staying under the 100-command village budget.
**Why:** Jeff flagged the Grand Watchtower as "still just a plain rectangle" and wants Projects to be the showpiece. The redesign focuses on visual depth through block variety, layered fill ordering, and taller proportions — all within the existing RCON budget constraint. The deepslate vs stone_brick contrast and taller turrets create more dramatic shadows and silhouette.
