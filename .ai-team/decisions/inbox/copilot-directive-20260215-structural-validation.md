### 2026-02-15: User directive — structural validation requirements for tests
**By:** Jeff (via Copilot)
**What:** All acceptance tests must verify: (1) all doors open and are wide enough for a player to walk through, (2) all stairs connect to floors and have room to enter and dismount, (3) all signs, torches, and levers are mounted on walls (not floating in air).
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. These are the structural integrity checks that prevent visual bugs from shipping.
