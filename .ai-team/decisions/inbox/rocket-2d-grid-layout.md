### 2026-02-23: Village layout restored to 2D grid with neighborhood quadrants
**By:** Rocket
**What:** Replaced single-row village layout with a 2D grid on a single Y-plane. Buildings are now arranged in a 2-column × N-row grid (using existing Columns=2 constant). Neighborhood zones use a 2×2 quadrant layout: NW=DotNetProject, NE=Azure, SW=ContainerOrDatabase, SE=Executable. Each zone contains a 2-column sub-grid of its buildings, with ZoneGap=20 blocks between quadrants. The fallback `GetStructureOrigin(int index)` also uses the 2-column grid. All buildings remain on the same horizontal plane (SurfaceY + 1) — no vertical stacking.
**Why:** Jeff explicitly rejected the single-row layout. A 2D grid with neighborhood grouping provides: (1) a compact, walkable village that doesn't stretch infinitely along one axis, (2) visual clustering of related services into quadrants for easy orientation, (3) compatibility with the canal system which reads bounds via GetVillageBounds/GetLakePosition, and (4) a natural town-like feel with streets and neighborhoods.
