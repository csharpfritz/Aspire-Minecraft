### 2026-02-15: Python and Node.js sample projects added; Grand Village demo created

**By:** Shuri

**What:** Added minimal Python (http.server) and Node.js (http module) sample APIs to MinecraftAspireDemo on main. Created a new GrandVillageDemo sample on milestone-5 that uses WithAllFeatures() + WithGrandVillage() with all resource types (Project, Container, Database, Azure, Python, Node.js) so every 15×15 grand building variant is visible.

**Why:** The existing sample only showed .NET projects, Redis, and Postgres. Adding Python and Node.js demonstrates that Aspire can orchestrate polyglot stacks and that the Workshop building type works for executable resources. The separate Grand Village demo gives a clean, focused showcase of the milestone-5 feature without cluttering the main sample's toggle pattern.
