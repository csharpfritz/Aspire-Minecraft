### 2026-02-15: Geometric validation tests for Grand buildings
**By:** Nebula
**What:** Added 26 comprehensive acceptance tests to StructureBuilderTests.cs that validate geometric relationships in Grand building generation. Tests catch three categories of bugs that escaped previous review cycles: (1) doorway visibility — ensures no decorative blocks (torches, lanterns) overlap door openings, (2) ground-level continuity — prevents stairs/decorations at y+1 on front faces outside door regions, (3) health indicator placement — validates glow blocks at exact DoorPosition-derived coordinates.
**Why:** Jeff rejected Grand Watchtower work 3 times due to geometric bugs (lower-level stair skirt visible at z-plane, entrance cluttered with decorations, floating torch in doorway). Existing tests only verified RCON command format, not spatial geometry. New tests parse setblock commands to extract x/y/z coordinates and assert geometric constraints: doorway region boundaries, front-face material restrictions, health indicator position validation. Pattern is reusable for any future Minecraft structure tests requiring spatial validation beyond string matching.
