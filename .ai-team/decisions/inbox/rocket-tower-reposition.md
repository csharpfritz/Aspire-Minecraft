### 2026-02-27: Grand Observation Tower repositioned north of village, entrance rotated south
**By:** Rocket
**What:** Tower moved from (20, -36) to (25, -45) — horizontally centered on the village x-axis (x=35) and placed 15 blocks north of the northern fence line (z=-10). Entrance rotated 180° from the min-Z (north) wall to the max-Z (south) wall so it faces toward the village. Tower now spans x=25-45, z=-45 to -25.
**Why:** Jeff wants the tower centered on the village and positioned as a landmark north of town, with the entrance welcoming players as they look south toward the village. The 15-block gap between tower and fence gives clean sightlines and prevents the tower from crowding the fence perimeter.
