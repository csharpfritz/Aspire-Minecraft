### 2026-02-16: User directive — technology branding colors on buildings
**By:** Jeffrey T. Fritz (via Copilot)
**What:** Each project technology must have distinctive color stripes and banners on their buildings:
- .NET projects (Watchtowers): Purple stripes (already done)
- JavaScript/Node apps (Workshops): Yellow stripes and yellow banners on top
- Python apps (Workshops): Yellow AND blue stripes with yellow and blue banners on top
Additionally, Python and Node applications must properly reflect their health status from the Aspire dashboard — the system is not detecting when they are running.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory
