### 2026-02-11: Sprint completion definition includes documentation
**By:** Jeffrey T. Fritz (via Copilot)
**What:** Going forward, all sprints must include updates to README and user documentation to be considered complete.
**Why:** User directive — documentation is a first-class deliverable, not an afterthought. Ensures features are always properly documented when shipped.
