### 2026-02-27: BridgeService — dynamic column detection + fence bounds checking
**By:** Rocket
**What:** Replaced static boulevard center formula with dynamic column detection from actual building positions. Added fence perimeter bounds validation before placing each bridge. Single-column layouts (e.g., SmallVillageDemo with 2 resources) now correctly skip boulevard bridges instead of placing them outside the fence. Multi-column layouts (e.g., GrandVillageDemo with 13 resources) continue to work as before.
**Why:** The old formula `BaseX + StructureSize + (Spacing - StructureSize) / 2` always produced X=35 regardless of actual building positions. When neighborhoods placed all buildings in column 0, this X was outside the east fence (fMaxX=34), creating bridges straddling the fence 10 blocks from any canal water. The fix derives boulevard positions from real geometry and validates against fence bounds, making bridge placement robust for any resource count (1, 2, 3, 10, 13+).
