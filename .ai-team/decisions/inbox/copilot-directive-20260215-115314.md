### 2026-02-15: User directive — Improve acceptance testing
**By:** Jeff (via Copilot)
**What:** Team must document learnings and improve acceptance testing on tasks before presenting them as completed. Too many iterations on the watchtower entrance (floating torch, cluttered entrance, stair skirt) were presented as "done" without catching visual/functional issues.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. Quality gate: agents should validate their work against known constraints (geometry, visibility, placement) before reporting completion.
