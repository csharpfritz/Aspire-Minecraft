### 2026-02-23: User directive — single-plane 2D grid with neighborhoods
**By:** Jeffrey T. Fritz (via Copilot)
**What:** Village buildings must be arranged in a 2-dimensional grid (X and Z) on a single Y-plane. Similar resource types should be grouped into neighborhoods. There must NOT be buildings stacked vertically — only one horizontal plane of buildings in the town.
**Why:** User request — captured for team memory. Jeff explicitly rejected the single-row layout and wants a proper 2D grid with neighborhood grouping.
