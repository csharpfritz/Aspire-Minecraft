### 2026-02-12: User directive — Famous Building API
**By:** Jeffrey T. Fritz (via Copilot)
**What:** Add `.AsMinecraftFamousBuilding(BigBenClockTower)` extension method on any Aspire resource, backed by an enum of available famous buildings with fixed building models. Syntax: `.AsMinecraftFamousBuilding(FamousBuilding.BigBenClockTower)`. Each enum value maps to a fixed, detailed Minecraft structure definition.
**Why:** User request — allows developers to assign iconic real-world building representations to their Aspire resources for a more visually rich and personalized Minecraft village experience. Planned for a future sprint.
