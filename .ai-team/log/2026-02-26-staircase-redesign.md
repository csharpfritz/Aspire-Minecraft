# 2026-02-26: Grand Observation Tower Spiral Staircase Redesign

**Requested by:** Jeffrey T. Fritz

**Lead:** Rocket

## What Happened

Rocket redesigned the Grand Observation Tower spiral staircase to improve player navigation and visual impact.

## Changes

- **Centered all 5 flights** on wall midpoints instead of corner positions
- **Widened stairs from 1-block to 2-block wide** for comfortable walking
- **Expanded stairwell holes from 3×4 to 5×5 blocks** to reduce head-bumping
- **Added landing platforms at floor transitions** (2×3 blocks each)
- Moved stairs away from cramped corners, making them a grand architectural feature

## Results

- **All 81 tower tests pass**
- Players can now navigate full 32-block height without fighting tight corners or narrow passages
- Layout is more intentional and visually grand
