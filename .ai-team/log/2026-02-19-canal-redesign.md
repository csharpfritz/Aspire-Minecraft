# Session: 2026-02-19 — Canal System Redesign

**Requested by:** Jeff Fritz

**Work:** Rocket redesigned the canal system — removed per-building zigzag branches, replaced with one straight back canal (E-W) behind all buildings feeding into a side trunk (N-S) that connects to the lake. Approximately 200 lines of branch/detour logic removed, replaced with cleaner directional segment builders.

**Key Outcome:** Simpler code, fewer RCON commands, cleaner visual layout, better alignment with village grid structure.
